# Community Bot Governance

i) Any Community Member can initiate a Petition For Change by posting a Comment under a recent Community Bot Post on the STEEM platform

ii) Once a Petition For Change has 20% of Community Member votes given in the comments under the post, it initiates a formal Proposal for Change and a Community Membership Vote (aka: Referendum).

iii) A Proposal For Change is formally drawn up by the Community Bot Operator who Posts it on the STEEM platform and it is voted on voluntarily by Community Members

iv) If over 50% of the Community Members who vote are in favour of the Proposal For Change then the Community Bot Operator makes best effort to implement the proposed changes

v) Community Bot Operator holds the Master Key for the Community Bot Account

vi) Community Bot Account has a pre-determined Power Down Threshold and once that is hit a Power Down is initiated on the Community Bot Account to prevent wealth accumulation

vii) The proceeds of the triggered Power Down is returned to the Community Members via purchase of a Delegation Lease to boost Community Bot Upvote value

viii) Community Members may decide to change Community Bot Operator via Petition For Change and the Master Key for the Community Bot Account will be transferred to the new Community Bot Operator

ix) The Active/Posting Keys of the Community Bot Account can be Granted/Revoked for Community Members via the Petition For Change process



# POLICIES

Target Voting Power & Daily Voting Budget : These shall be set so as to ensure all members have the opportunity to use ANZUB once every 12 hours. In the event that the effective Voting Power (VP) is pushed to under 70% the voting limitations shall be set to once every 24 hours.

Contribution Methods : This details how the community is going to contribute to the bot. It could be via Delegations and/or Liquid STEEM payments and/or Upvotes.

Contribution Weightings : All votes given by our ANZUB bot shall be set at a fixed percentage and as such shall be considered to be uniform, fair and equal for all members.

Non-Contributor Budget : The community can decide to introduce measures defining limitations based on contributions in the event that it considers this to be necessary and in the best interest of further enhancing the overall quality and effectiveness of this service.

Vote Frequency : It is currently set at 1 vote per member every 12 hours. However in the event that the VP is consumed to under 70% then it shall be set to 1 vote per member every 24 hours.

Power Down Threshold : The STEEM POWER (SP) level at which a Power Down needs to be initiated to reinvest funds back to the community bots SP (as outlined in Governance articles vi. and vii.) shall be 1,500 Steem. Powering down to 501 SP. So effectively 1,000 Steem can be accumulated and used as per the listed Governance article.

Active Key Allocation : i)The active key shall be safe kept by the person(s) managing and operating the bot along with one other member named by the community.

Self Voting: The community shall determine what the manual voting responsibilities are of those holding keys. i.e. voting on the community bot posts on the wall of ANZUB.

Key Allocation : i) The community shall determine who all shall be authorized to post in the name of the Community on the wall of our community bots profile,
ii) Likewise the community shall determine what the responsibilities are of those holding keys.

Posting Guidelines : Detailing how the Bot is going to Post. Such as technical information on how the Bot is running, community promotion, parameter changes or other Proposals For Change initiated by the members etc. Also guidelines such as not using profanity or making personal attacks on members or non-members within the Bots posts or even not showing favoritism to any individual members etc.

Extra Voting Contingencies : ANZUB can be used to manually upvote community organized posts that are solely for the purpose of community organized charity fundraising.

NOTE - These would also need to be budgeted for, so that they do not affect the Target Voting Power negatively.

Extra Expense Contingencies : These shouldnâ€™t exist as all liquid funds shall be converted to SP. However in the event such do arise i.e Delegation Lease renewals or use of Promotional Bots, the bot managers and operators (Key holders) in coordination with community representatives have the responsibility to inform the community and to take appropriate actions in the best interests of the community and our community bot.
